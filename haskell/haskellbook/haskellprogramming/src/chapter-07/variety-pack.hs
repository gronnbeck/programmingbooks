-- 1. Given the following declarations

-- k (x, y) = x
-- k1 = k ((4-1), 10)
-- k2 = k ("three", (1 + 2))
-- k3 = k (3, True)

-- a) What is the type of k?
-- b) What is the type of k2? Is it the same type as k1 or k3?
-- c) Of k1, k2, k3, which will return the number 3 as the result?

-- a) (a, b) -> a
-- b) k2 = "three" => String and no
-- c) k1 and k3

-- 2. Fill in the definition of the following function:
-- -- Remember: Tuples have the
--              same syntax for their
-- --           type constructors and
-- --           their data constructors.
-- f :: (a, b, c)
-- -> (d, e, f)
-- -> ((a, d), (c, f))
-- f = undefined

f :: (a, b, c) -> (d, e, f) -> ((a, d), (c, f))
f (a, _, c) (d, _, f) = ((a, d), (c, f))
